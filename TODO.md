* confirm that a bootstrapping swimmer does not respond to other bootstrapping swimmers
* force include seed member in dynamic host to join
* append dynamic to already specified hosts to join
* document the importance of starting the seed member alone and first
* handle /_SYSTEM/_NETWORK/_SETTINGS/NAME overwrite from each cluster member
* update member, eg. remote restarted and changed happn port or cluster name (remove)
* handle returned member not fully departed yet Member.resume()
* orchestrator subscribes to configurable list of events
* prevent happn login with clusterName into other clusterName?
